    <h1 class="who">WHO AM I?</h1>
      <p>I find this to be the hardest question to ever answer. I mean I'd rather do mathematical calculations and physics practicals for a whole week with no rest (ok, maybe I'm exaggerating just a little bit) than answer this question.
        What really is the simplest answer to this? I'm a girl? Of course I am, you can see it. Should I talk about my likes? My hobbies? My education? Or should I tell you about my family and my upbringing?
        I usually dread job interviews, or just interviews because of this.</p>
      <p>After doing what I'm really good at, overthinking, and soul searching I came up with an answer that I usually spit out robotically: "I am a lady who is ever jovial, very patient, fun-loving, understanding and who believes in equality and fairness."
        Sounds really good huh? This is until the interviewer looks at me expectantly and this is when I realize I have to describe myself more. So then I resort to my hobbies: "I enjoy reading novels and swimming. I also indulge in movies and series in my free time (which is all the time:) )"
      <p>So then I pat myself on my back mouthing (Great job babe!) Then I hear "So tell me about your strengths and weaknesses". Should I tell the person holding my future-job in his/her hands that at times I'm really lazy? Or that I love partying? So then for my weakness, I put a fake frown and say "I'm a perfectionist! This affects my work because I'm so obssessed with making everything perfect that I don't meet my deadline."
        Now this sounds really impressive until one of the members of the panel, or just the single interviewer, who is a real perfectionist not a chinku one like yours truly, actually notices something trivial like a spelling mistake on your cv! Now I know some of you reading this are like "Aaaiy!! Hiyo tu?"
        But my "fellow" perfectionists know that however small, a mistake is still a mistake. So you start blubbering there trying to explain yourself. The silver lining is that you still end up getting the job!
